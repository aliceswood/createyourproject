# Class Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

## 2. Design the Class Interface
Include the initializer and public methods with all parameters and return values.

# EXAMPLE

class Reminder
  def initialize(name) # name is a string
    # ...
  end

  def remind_me_to(task) # task is a string
    # No return value
  end

  def remind()
    # Throws an exception if no task is set
    # Otherwise, returns a string reminding the user to do the task
  end
end
## 3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations.

EXAMPLE

1 - comment to explain test
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("Walk the dog")
reminder.remind() # => "Walk the dog, Kay!"

2 - comment to explain test
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind() # fails with "No task set."

3 - comment to explain test
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("")
reminder.remind() # => ", Kay!"
Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.

## 4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
